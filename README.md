# Normalformlearning

Hello fellow programer!
This is a learning program. It's a stump of a program possible to determine in which normal form (up to the 3rd) the given table is.
I've done it in a little bit of hurry so it is not assured, that you can not break it.

How does it work?
First you just edit the table entries by clicking the topmost row of the table which is visible in the background.
You can insert 20 columns this way. You can edit them, but leaving one empty makes the program ignore the columns after it.
Then you drag and drop the columns to the lower text fields. These are supposed to be the functional dependencies working in this table.
To the left you drop the keys and to the right the dependent attributes.
You can drop more attributes into these text fields.
After you are done press the Evaluade button to the bottom right and the lights will show you in which normal form your table is.
Also in the console you will have the answer why it is not a higher one (unless it's in the 3rd NF).

You can also see the examples I made by pressing the "Lade Aufgabe" button (suddenly german).
This will load any example placed in the testdb.db file (if you understand how it works, you can insert your own examples)
